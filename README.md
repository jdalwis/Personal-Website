README for Janith's Personal Portfolio Website
Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Janith's personal portfolio website. This site is uniquely designed to mimic the aesthetics and functionality of a classic terminal interface, providing a nostalgic yet modern web experience. It's a creative way to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey in the realm of technology.

Concept
The core concept of this website is to blend the retro charm of a terminal interface with contemporary web technologies. It features a command-line inspired user interface, where visitors can navigate through my portfolio as if they are interacting with a terminal. This includes typing commands to open sections like 'About', 'Projects', 'Skills', and 'Contact'. The website is designed to be interactive, engaging, and a reflection of my passion for both the history and the future of technology.
